<div id="volleyball">
    <h3>Volleyball</h3>
    <p> I started playing volleyball when I was about 10 years old. <br>
    I played throughout my middle school and high school years as a full-time setter.<br>
    Not only did I play in school, but I played it outside with my friends.<br>
    We would go to the park every day after school and played.My role switched <br>
    from a setter to a defensive player. I traveled to Minnesota, Georgia, and <br>
    South Carolina to play in competitive tournaments. Most of the time, I played <br>
    volleyball outdoors and had an annual sports tournament with the Hmong community.

<div id="photography">
    <h3>Photography</h3>
    <p> Growing up, I always watched America's Next Top Model. I was intrigued<br>
        with the makeup, glam, clothes, and being able to create interesting photos.<br>
        That's when I opened up a whole new world of loving photography. I love creating <br>
        images that make you feel something like a kid who looks at their idol. I wanted <br>
        to create that same feeling of extreme bliss when you look at an image. Not only <br>
        did I take photos of landscaping, I also tried out modeling. Though taking photos <br>
        in my own backyard didn't count, I loved the idea of dressing up and creating a <br>
        cool photo in hopes that one day a little girl or boy would look up to and want to <br>
        become me. Photography will always be a passion of mine, though I hardly pick up a camera anymore.

<div id="makeup">
    <h3>Special Effects Makeup</h3>
    <p> Along with photography, I loved creating horror and gore theme makeup. <br>
        The idea of being able to create something that looks realistic though isn't <br>
        intrigues me. I create different looks that could either be mystical, gore, <br>
        pretty, look-alikes, animals, zombies... you name it! I enjoy the reaction I <br>
        get from people who enjoy my looks and being told that I could turn it into <br>
        a job. I didn't continue this as a career, but is definitely a passion I still<br>
        hold onto till this day.

<div id="traveling">
    <h3>Traveling</h3>
    <p> Throughout my life, I've always wanted to travel. To explore the world <br>
        and to be able to see different cultures. Myself coming from a different <br>
        culture, I love seeing how it resembles or differs from mine. I have yet to <br>
        travel out of the country but it is definitely one of my goals in life to <br>
        travel to most of the possible countries. I have gone to many beautiful beaches<br>
        here in the US and love traveling to different hiking spots with amazing views. <br>
        It's crazy how everybody speaks a different language, but can all come together and <br>
        enjoy each other's different culture.

    <div id="family">
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p> My family is very family-oriented. Sometimes I think a <br>
            little too much. But I love enjoying each and everyone's <br>
            company and coming together and laughing and enjoying time<br>
            together. Time is always fleeting, and I choose to enjoy it with <br>
            my loved ones. We all grew up together and are very close knit <br>
            and now that everybody is grown up and going their own path and living <br>
            their own lives, it is definitely a lot harder to be together. <br>
            Mostly, I love having the family out together to enjoy some time in the<br>
            outdoors whether it is hiking, swimming, picnicing. Family is and will<br>
            always be super important to me.
